The Winter Warfare Mod (for Minecraft 1.6.4):

Contender in Modjam 3.

Construction for this mod starts Friday 12-13-13.

Current ideas:

-An icepick which mines ice.
-Iceballs - which come from ice.
-Rocky Snowballs - Snowballs with rocks in the middle.
-Exploding snowballs - on impact, detonates a harmful explosion which also sends 	snowballs in flying in all directions.
-May be more snowballs.
-Snowball launcher - Can launch all of the different types of snowballs and potatoes 	at a high velocity (more damage).
-Snowball Shotgun - Launches three projectiles at once.
-May be more launchers.
-Projectile chooser - chooses the projectile to be launched from the launcher.
-Abominable Snowman - spawns in Snowy biomes and throws snowballs.
-Abominable Iceman - spawns in frozen oceans and rivers and throws iceballs.
-May be more abominable snowmen.
-Snow Dungeon - holds decent loot and is guarded by abominable snowmen.
-Ice Dungeon - Holds decent loot and is guarded by abominable icemen.
-Ice Golem - Like a snow golem but throws iceballs.
-There may be more things but I haven't thought of them yet and I'm not sure if I'll 		have the time.
